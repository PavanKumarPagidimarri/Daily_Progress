## Cloud Computing: 
- Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Computing services include common IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking. Cloud services also expand the traditional IT offerings to include things like Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI).
- Because cloud computing uses the internet to deliver these services, it doesnâ€™t have to be constrained by physical infrastructure the same way that a traditional datacenter is. That means if you need to increase your IT infrastructure rapidly, you donâ€™t have to wait to build a new datacenterâ€”you can use the cloud to rapidly expand your IT footprint.
## ðŸ§¾ **CapEx vs OpEx 

- CapEx (Capital Expenditure)
    
    - Used for **buying or upgrading long-term assets**
        
    - One-time or infrequent **large investments**
        
    - Examples: Buying servers, data centers, routers, buildings
        
    - Treated as **assets** and depreciated over time
        
    - Company **owns** the asset
        
    - **Example in IT**: Building your own data center or buying physical servers
        
- **OpEx (Operational Expenditure)**
    
    - Covers **day-to-day operational costs**
        
    - **Recurring** and ongoing payments
        
    - Examples: Cloud subscriptions, internet bills, electricity, salaries
        
    - Treated as **expenses** in accounting for the period they occur
        
    - Company **does not own** the service or asset
        
    - **Example in IT**: Using AWS, Azure, or GCP (pay-as-you-go model)
        

---

- CapEx = **Buying a car** (you own it)
    
- OpEx = **Using Uber** (you pay per use, no ownership)

## Consumption - based model:
Cloud service providers operate on a consumption-based model, which means that end users only pay for the resources that they use.
- Better cost prediction
- Prices for individual resources and services are provided
- Billing is based on actual usage
### **Characteristics of Cloud Computing 

1. **On-Demand Self-Service**
    
    - Users can provision computing resources (like servers, storage) **automatically** without human interaction.
        
    - Example: Launching a VM in Azure without calling the IT team.
        
2. **Broad Network Access**
    
    - Services are accessible over the internet from **any device** (laptop, mobile, tablet) anywhere in the world.
        
    - Example: Accessing cloud storage (like Google Drive) on phone or PC.
        
3. **Resource Pooling**
    
    - Cloud providers use a **multi-tenant model** to serve multiple users with the same physical resources.
        
    - Resources (like memory, processing) are dynamically assigned based on demand.
        
4. **Rapid Elasticity / Scalability**
    
    - Resources can be scaled **up or down quickly** as per user demand.
        
    - Example: Auto-scaling in AWS when traffic increases.
        
5. **Measured Service / Pay-as-You-Go**
    
    - Cloud usage is **monitored, controlled, and billed** based on actual consumption.
        
    - You pay only for what you use â€“ like utility services.
        
6. **High Availability and Resilience**
    
    - Cloud systems are designed to be **fault-tolerant**, with backups, replication, and redundancy.
        
    - Example: Data stored in multiple availability zones in Azure.
        
7. **Multi-Tenancy**
    
    - Multiple users (tenants) share the same infrastructure but have **logically isolated** environments.
        
    - Ensures cost-effectiveness and resource utilization.
        
8. **Security**
    
    - Offers built-in **security measures** like encryption, identity access management, firewalls, and compliance.
        
    - Example: Azure Active Directory for identity management.
