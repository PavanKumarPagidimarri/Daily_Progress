1. #What is On-Premise?

**On-premise** refers to an IT infrastructure where the hardware and software are physically located within the organization's own premises or data centers, rather than hosted on a third-party providerâ€™s infrastructure. The organization manages everything in-house, from servers and networking equipment to security and maintenance.

2.  #Why Do We Need On-Premise?

On-premise solutions are typically used when organizations want **full control** over their systems, data, and security. 

#### Example of On-Premise Usage:

- **Large Companies**:  
    For example, a **bank** may need to store and process customer financial data on-premise due to security concerns. The bank would build its own data centers to store sensitive information like transaction history, account balances, etc. They would use private servers and in-house teams to ensure compliance with financial regulations.
    
- **Hospitals/Medical Facilities**:  
    A **hospital** needs to store patient medical records securely. On-premise solutions allow them to have full control over the sensitive health data, ensuring they meet compliance standards (e.g., HIPAA in the U.S.).

- **On-Premise**: Own the hardware, total control, high upfront costs, security compliance, and need for dedicated IT staff.
    
- **Cloud**: Rent hardware and services, flexible scaling, no hardware maintenance, and ongoing subscription costs.
